# Adaptive A3: Energy-Aware Control

This task introduces an engineering trade-off between correction quality and command energy.

## Why this task matters

In practical AO hardware, command magnitude is linked to:
- actuator power/heat,
- long-run reliability,
- drive electronics margin.

Residual-only control tends to produce dense/high-energy commands.
This task asks for better overall efficiency.

## Environment Dependencies

- Python: `3.10+` (tested with `python`)
- Baseline candidate runtime: `numpy`
- Verification runtime: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and the external `aotools` package
- Task-specific oracle dependency: `scikit-learn` (used by `verification/reference_controller.py`, `sklearn.linear_model.Lasso`)
- Recommended one-shot install from repo root: `python -m pip install -r benchmarks/Optics/requirements.txt`

## Run

```bash
cd benchmarks/Optics/adaptive_energy_aware_control
python verification/evaluate.py
```
